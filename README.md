### Vireo

A compact parallel execution runtime for VIs saved in VI assembly format (.via files). The *./Documents* folder includes instructions for building and testing on different systems.

The Vireo project provides a subset of LabVIEW runtime functionality for smaller targets. An example of its use is the
EV3 support in the _LabVIEW Module for LEGO® MINDSTORMS®_. The LabVIEW features supported is primarily defined by the features needed for the VIA files generated by LabVIEW. Features beyond that core set, that can be accessed directly from VIA source written by hand, should be considered experimental, and subject to change at any time. A complete list of disclaimers and terms is described in LICENSE.txt
